I am making a thread to update the display list. 
    DONE 1: Insert locks surrounding shared object with in main and refresh thread
    2: Create thread loop with locks and refresh display list
    3: Start and end thread. When will the thread be launched? When will the thread be commanded to exit and call join?
        - Login: launch thread, after the user content is created
        - Logout: exit thread, before user content is deconstructed
